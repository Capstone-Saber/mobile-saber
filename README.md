# SABER MOBILE DEVELOPMENT
***
## 1. Overview
Saber app is an intuitive, easy-to-use, and environment-impactful that addresses the urgent issue of carbon emissions from buildings. Through this app, the users will be able to
reduce the carbon emission through electricity efficient usage. As the user journey begin, the login and registration will be the first step to take since the account will be 
binded into installed IoT devices. After that, information will be provided for users regarding the electricity consumptions. The dashboard is split into two segments, which are
Power Consumption, which basically monitor the electricity usage from IoT and Predict Consumption, which provides information such as total electricity usage and the average also
